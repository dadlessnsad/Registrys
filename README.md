# Royalties Registry Dapp

## Description

Royalties Registry Dapp is a decentralized application that allows users to register a royalties receiver address and percentage on a ERC721 or ERC1155 collection they own.

## How it works
User connects their preferred wallet to the dapp and inputs the address of the collection they own.

If the collection is owned by the user, the dapp will display the address of the royalties receiver and the percentage of the royalties, if it exists. If the collection is not owned by the user, the dapp will display a message saying that the collection is not owned by the user.

The Owner of a collection can then set the royalties receiver address and percentage of the new royalties for the collection.

After the transaction is complete the dapp will display the new royalties receiver address and percentage of the new royalties.
